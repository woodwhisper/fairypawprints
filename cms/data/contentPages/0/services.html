<h2>Services</h2>

<p>What is this website here for? What services can we offer?</p>
        <p>We're a very small two person part time publishing house. We don't do advertising, we just manage
        the process of getting something up and on the web. We are the cheap and hassle free way to get something
        available for sale.</p>
        <p>As such, our costs are very low, but we're very constrained on time, so we ask before either side
        commits to expensive work, you use the contact page and talk to us about what you want done, and how
        much it will cost</p>
        <p>Anyway here's what we offer...</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Editing</strong> : Alex has experience in editing both short articles as well as novels. We provide here a service for
        editing short articles on almost anything, and longer texts in fantasy and Sci Fi genres.</li>
    <li><strong>Proofreading</strong> : For a less comprehensive treatment of your texts, Alex is also willing to be able to proofread
        items and texts you have written.</li>
    <li><strong>E-Publishing</strong> : Do you have that book or story you want to have published but was too afraid to ask. Fairy
        Paw Prints will publish your book or story for you, taking your words and getting it ready for sale with
        Amazon.  We can combing it with our proofreading service above to make sure your words say what you thinnk
        they do.</li>
    <li><strong>Web hosting & Design</strong> : Neale has over 10 years experience at building web applications, while not a graphical
         genius, he knows how to get a website up and running. Due to time constraints though we'll only be
         looking at smaller sites for the moment.</li>
