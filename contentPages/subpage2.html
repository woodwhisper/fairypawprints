<h2>Writing</h2>
<p> Both Alex and Neale are writers.  Or at least would be writers. </p>
<p> Alex is the more professional of the two of us, having produced journalistic critique in the computer games area for a printed magazine, and then editing a local magazine. </p>
<p> Neale is more a ideas writer, writing for himself, and well having ideas which way outstrip his abilities.</p>
<p> As such expect to see a majority of Alex's writing's here, rather than Neales.</p>
