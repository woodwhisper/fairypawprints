<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>Both Alex and Neale are writers</p>

<p>Alex is currently studying Professional and Creative Writing at Deakin University, and holds a Diploma in
    Professional Writing and Editing. She has been writing since she was 12 years old, and claims that writing is in her
    blood (she is not the first of her family to be a writer). In the 90s, she was published a couple of times as a game
    reviewer for GameStar Magazine (an Australian mag, long since out of print). She has edited a local Melbourne kink
    scene magazine.</p>

<p>Neale is more of an ideas man, writing for himself, as well as having ideas which way outstrip his abilities.</p>

<h3>Current Writing Projects.</h3>

<h4>Unholy Alliance: The Fire Wizard (working title)</h4>

<p>In a world where women are literally the property of their fathers or husbands, women wielding magic are burned at
    the stake for witchcraft. So it isn't really a surprise that when Kendra's magical powers awaken and Brant, the town
    priest, asks for her hand in marriage, she runs away to join her mother's people - the persecuted People of the
    Trees. But there is more to this story than just Kendra's struggle to accept her new identity - for in the heavens
    brews a war hundreds of years in the making... Kendra's journey has only just begun.</p>

<h4>The Victoria Harper series</h4>

<p>When magic returns to the modern world, crime becomes even more complex. When Victoria Harper, Forensic Mage, is
    called to act for the defence in a case where the police mage has seriously mishandled an investigation, Victoria
    finds herself nominated as a consultant to the Police, helping them solve crimes with a magical twist. But there are
    strong currents working in the background, and the entire world is in harms way.</p>

This is a collaboration between Neale and Alex. The concept is Neale's, the writing is Alex's.

<h4>Origins series</h4>

<p>Superheroes exist, and not just in the United States. The Origins series, as the title suggests, is a series of
    stories about the origins of Australian superheroes.</p>

<h5>Origin Jennings</h5>

<p>Kerry Jennings is a Sergeant in the Australian Army, a communications specialist. While on a training exercize, she
    is kidnapped by robots under the command of Dr Karlton, a villian who loves his experiments as if they were his
    family. He injects her with nanites, and gives her the mission to return another experiment to him, experiment
    Seven, formerly known as Simone Patterson, and currently known to the public as the superhero Ice Strider. Things
    get complicated when the nanites mess with her body chemistry, and Kerry can no longer distinguish between her own
    feelings, and the impulses of the nanites programming.</p>

<p>Other stories in this series are in the works, specifically Origin Seven, and Origin Black Archer and the Star
    Mage.</p>
