<h2>Web development</h2>
<p>Welcome to Neale's part of the website</p>
<p>This site is as much about allowing me to experiment with various libraries and techniques as anything else</p>
<p>I'm a long time PHP OO developer, currently looking to expand my talents into front end coding as well, with a LOT of experience of developing for the LAMP stack.</p>
<p>Currently working, both professionally and on some personal side projects (like this web site), I plan to use this
      site to keep my profession skills updated and then some.</p>
<h3>
    This site
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This site could be coded as a simple website, but is instead a more complex 'single' page app using AJAX.</li>
    <li>Using an old version of twitter bootstrap at the moment for basic layout and navigation.</li>
    <li>Using jQuery for Ajax and back end page load.</li>
    <li>Using Angular for page automation</li>
    <li>The contact us page is designed to be as anti spam as possible without adding extra user stuff, plus feeds
         to a PHP form to be processed</li>
    <li>The backend is a API PHP system using MVC techniques with Doctrine 2 as it's Database layer.</li>
</ul>
