<h2>Web developement</h2>
<p>Welcome to Neale's part of the website</p>
<p>This site is as much about allowing me to experiment with various libraries and techniques as anything else</p>
<p>I'm a long time PHP OO developer, currently looking to expand my talents into front end coding as well, with a LOT of experience of developing for the LAMP stack.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in hiring myself as a PHP developer, I'm currently available for both permanent and full time work, please contact me via the contact us page for rates and further information </p>

</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Currently being used to test my building 'single' load websites. That is websites that never need to 'reload' the full page from the server, just load parts of it in the background via AJAX.</li>
    <li>Using an old version of twitter bootstrap at the moment for basic layout and navigation.</li>
    <li>Using jQuery for Ajax and back end page load.</li>
    <li>@todo Add anti-spam contact form + Comment link + Donation/Encouragement buttons</li>
</ul>
<h3>Up and coming projects</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Super Simple Web (name to be finalised based on what is available :). Based on the idea that to have a web presence should be so simple, everyone should have something for themselves.</li>
    <li>RPG master. A web based communications tool to provide a more modern version of paper notes, to work on tablets and laptops using websockets to allow communications between JS client and PHP/node backend.</li>
